        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          <img id="profileimage" src="profile.jpg" /> I am an adventurer, a dancer, a student, a teacher, and a lover of life. In my spare time, I salsa dance, hike, practice martial arts, run, play video games, read, write, create, and play. My favorite color is <span class="pink">pink</span>, my favorite liquor is tequila, and my favorite book is <span class="italic">"The Name of The Wind"</span> by Patrick Rothfuss. I love summer dresses, warm beaches, the touch of sunlight on my skin, fluffy animals, good reads, and pretty pictures. I have a sassy cat named Snowdrop, a rambunctuous dog named Toby, and a typically awesome but sometimes just tolerable husband named Adam.
